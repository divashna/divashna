            <p class="p">COVID Connect was a case study undertaken to determine how to effectively communicate public health messages with all Australians.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">The importance of public health messaging</h3>
        <p>The outbreak of COVID-19 and the spread of misinformation that has followed has highlighted the need to keep ethnic and minority communities in Australia engaged with public health messages regarding COVID-19 symptoms and testing. To address a lack of engagement with health alerts, I designed a product where individuals could locate relevant, accurate and real-time information about the virus and ensure all Australians are empowered to engage with public health messages.</p>

      <!-- preliminary research -->
      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Preliminary Research</h3>
        <p>In order to understand the issues multicultural communities face when accessing health information, I first conducted preliminary research on the barriers and pain points experienced by such communities. As part of my research, I conducted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Secondary research in the form of background research</li>
          <li>A SWOT analysis of four existing competitor services- The <em>COVIDSafe</em> app, <em>Coronavirus Australia</em> app, <em>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Health Alert</em> and the <em>Australian Government WhatsApp Channel for COVID-19</em></li>
          <li>An online ethnography of 62 reviews from the four competitors; and</li>
          <li>A questionnaire which produced 19 unique insights from users</li>
        </ul>

            <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Research Results</h3>
            <p>The results showed that multicultural communities that had previously been disadvantaged by the health system struggled to access accurate and reliable information about the virus due to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A lack of engagement with community and/or cultural leaders</li>
              <li>Poor accessibility</li>
              <li>Limited availability of resources</li>
              <li>Poor multilingual support; and</li>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Problem Definition</h3>
        <p>The research indicated that a major weakness of existing health messages was a lack of multilingual support, which limited engagement with emerging health advice. This pain point was consequently selected as the basis for the product development. A problem statement was established to simplify the problem and highlight key user needs that would need to be addressed in the final design:</p>
        <p><em>Multicultural communities cannot engage with COVID-19 public health messages as they arrive due to a lack of resources provided for multilingual and non-English speakers. The solution should provide a platform where individuals can instantaneously and actively engage with health messages in order to reduce misconceptions regarding coronavirus symptoms and testing procedures.</em></p>

            <p>To develop a platform that allows multicultural communities to engage with public health messages about COVID-19 symptoms and testing, I created sketches to determine which features and components could be integrated in a web application to accomplish this. Multiple iterations of a web-based application were created to identify a concept that would best meet the needs of users.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 class="h3-heading" role="heading" aria-level="3">Prototype</h3>
        <p>A high-fidelity prototype of the final concept, COVID Connect, was then established. The website was designed to automatically offer multilingual support through one's browser, whereas information would also be made accessible through the use of icons and images.</p>
        <p>Users are also offered the ability to contact community leaders in their language of choice so they can actively engage with health messages regarding COVID-19 symptoms and testing. The final website offers an accessible, reliable and engaging means of locating COVID-19 health messages in comparison to existing products. As such, the solution addresses barriers to accessing health messages while reducing misconceptions about COVID-19 symptoms and testing procedures.</p>

        <p>The COVID Connect project has challenged me to create products that are accessible to all. This project has further encouraged me to investigate barriers to the public health system in order to design a solution that is feasible, usable and appealing for all Australians.</p>
